        </br>
      I'm an ex-trader with a diverse set of experiences who thrives in ambiguity and fast-paced environments.
      With experience on Wall Street, at a start-up incubator, and now at Targetâ€™s media arm, people count on me to be driven, resourceful, and collaborative to get things done.

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <h3>The Short Version:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ran a trading book on Wall Street offering structured investments, meeting our institutional and retail client needs and delivering revenue to the bottom line</li>
          <li>Worked with early-stage start-ups on their businesses and facilitated strategic workshops for start-up founders, refining their use cases, product-market fit, and strategic vision</li>
          <li>Led an incubator's rebrand, crafting a clear vision and mission, and creating a cohesive online presence, even building their marketing website from scratch</li>
          <li>Took a programming bootcamp to develop my coding and product thinking, developing several web applications</li>
          <li>Launched ad products at a media network, growing revenue in their awareness-driven top of funnel offerings</li>
          <li>Facilitated the building of a three-year long-range plan for a media network, driving thought leadership and gaining buy-in with senior leaders on where we needed to invest</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Long Version:</h3>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/trading_desk.jpg" class="image left margin-right" style="width: 47%" />
        <p>
          After graduating from Columbia University, I cut my teeth on the trading floor, as the only woman on an all-male trading team.
          It was an invaluable experience working with incredibly sharp minds, who taught me how to perform under pressure, be comfortable with data, and manage risk.
        </br></br>
        Running a trading book meant owning a book of business; I collaborated with Sales and Structuring teams to identify opportunities and create investment offerings to meet client needs, and then, as the trader, I priced the offering, ensured the processes were in place so it could scale, and managed the risk and P&L. 
      </br></br>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/potato_workshop.jpg" class="image right margin-left" style="width: 47%" />
          <p>Post 2008, innovating with structured investments was difficult with tightening regulation, and I entered the start-up space, bringing the financial rigor and structured problem solving I'd developed to a small start-up incubator in Singapore. At Potato Productions, I rolled up my sleeves in a lean, scrappy environment, and wore multiple hats; from working on the incubator's brand and strategy, to leading workshops with early-stage startups.
            To strengthen my abilities to consult with tech-based startups, I took a 12-week bootcamp to develop my coding and product thinking.
          </br></br>
          Now, my diverse experiences have shaped the leader I am today and the value I bring to organizations; I am both a strategist and builder, who tackles complex problems through qualitative and quantitative means, values a cross-pollination of ideas for creative problem-solving, and can build macros in spreadsheets one moment, and present a compelling case to senior leadership the next.
          I hit the ground running by building strong partnerships, leading data-driven decision-making, and, at the end of the day, actively listening as though I'm wrong.
        </br></br>
        Currently, I am at Target's media network, taking ad products from concept to launch, collaborating with Product and Sales teams to determine roadmaps and bring them to life.

          across country offices. Our team used Agile practices to prioritise
          features, formulate a release plan, and execute development sprints.
